# spring-boot-multitenant
This is a Spring Boot multi-tenant sample using multiple datasources and Schema to persist data in different schemas. 
That is using the [Hibernate multi-tenancy support](https://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.2/devguide/en-US/html/ch16.html) working with the separate database strategy.
By Default Multiple DataSource is enable. It works with JdbcTemplate Which is not natively supported . When using Multi-tenancy in Spring Boot Table needs to be created externally. Auto table creation
needs to be turned off. We will use Public Schema as the default schema. The DDL to create the table are present in DDL.sql in resources folder. 
## Compile and package

Being Maven centric, you can compile and package it without tests using:
```
mvn clean package -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```
Once you have your jar file, you can run it.

## Run it

To run it you can go to the Maven target folder generated and execute the following command:
```
java -jar multitenant-XXX.jar
```

## Testing

Once started you can go and request the data using different tenants :

* `curl -X POST   http://localhost:8080/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-TenantID: test1' -d '{"name":"Mumbai"}'`
* `curl -X POST   http://localhost:8080/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-TenantID: test2' -d '{"name":"Kolkata"}'`
*  `curl -X GET   http://localhost:8080/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-TenantID: test1'`
* `curl -X GET   http://localhost:8080/ -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'X-TenantID: test2' `
